# Thanks for using my plugin! #
# The prefix will always be before the message, so you don't need to put the prefix before every message! #
# ChatColors are supported, for more information, go to http://ess.khhq.net/mc/ for all of the colors #
# Finally, if the %PLAYER% is the console, the name will be "CONSOLE" #
# Once again, thanks! #
